        <p>Full Stack Web Developer holding a Master of Science in Information Technology from the University of Massachusetts - Boston, and a certificate from the Denver University Coding Bootcamp focusing on web development using the MERN stack.</p>
        <p>I enjoy both front end and back end development, especially when it comes to bringing pages to life using JavaScript, React.js or jQuery. I also do not shy away when it comes to using MongoDB, Node.js, MySQL or other back end technologies.</p>
        <p>As an effective communicator and critical thinker, I bring nine years of experience working in teams and individually on projects of various sizes. Previously, I leveraged these skills to improve accounting and auditing practices. Currently, I am perpetually impressed by applications that work dynamically, interactively and are scalable. I would love to join a team to help make the web more beautiful, user-friendly and accessible.</p>

Ivan Is a member of the Burning Man Project as part of Leave No Trace volunteering team that promotes sustainable practices and ensures the land the project occupies is in the same or a better state than how it was before. </p>
